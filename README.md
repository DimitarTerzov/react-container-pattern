# Share Code Between React Native and React JS

## Sample application that contains skeleton for creating React Native/React JS application with `container pattern`

I have created `Container components` that are shared between Mobile and 
Web applications. Web application with specific components for web is created. 
React Native components should be implemented and a Mobile application. 

Application counts button clicks and save the count in db. Click count is displayed 
and refreshed after every click.

To test it run Flask and React applications.
